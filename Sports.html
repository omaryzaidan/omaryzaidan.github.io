				<p>I grew up playing many sports which fostered my love for sports. I played basketball, crosscountry, track and field, and wrestling on a team. However, I played almost every sport for fun. Some include volleyball, table tennis, soccer, spikeball, and football. I excelled most at wrestling, however, after a severe knee injury my freshman year, I wasn't able to continue wrestling for the rest of my highschool career. I ended up being the team manager and assistant coach for the team.<p>
