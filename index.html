				<p> I'm Omar Zaidan. I'm a junior here at UW currently studying <a href="https://ischool.wisc.edu">Information Sciences</a>, with a Data science Certificate and Business Certificate. I’m a part of a handful of student organizations and on the board of a couple of them which allow me to always meet new people which is a blessing. I also enjoy spending time with friends and playing sports. Growing up I played sports. I grew up in Appleton Wisconsin, but I’m originally from Palestine. I went to high school in Appleton and did sports growing up like basketball, cross country, track, and wrestling, but I excelled the most at wrestling. I ended up graduating high school a year early and,  going into college, I made sure to join many student organizations and meet new people as well as focus on my studies. Being active in the community is one of the reasons I had the opportunity to apply and receive positions on the board of a few student organizations and other positions. Going forward I would like to find a suitable internship and complete my major here at UW. I don’t know which direction I want to go in terms of my career, however I plan to continue to research and keep my mind open. I also want to travel and gain more life experiences and make sure to grow as an individual in all areas of life.</p>
