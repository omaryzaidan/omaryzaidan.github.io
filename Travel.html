				<p>One of the things I love to do is travel. I really enjoy experiencing different cultures and meeting new people. I myself am originally from Palestine and grew up with a different culture. I have never gotten the chance to visit Palestine however I've been to a few different countries where I got to visit great cities, try new foods, try new things, learn about different cultures and meet new people. Some countries I've visited are Saudi Arabia, UAE, Netherlands, Jordan, and Oman. Each country has a different set of experiences to offer.</p>
